# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Version control is Git. It is useful because through this method of managing changes to files you and your team can then: keep track of changes made to code, track who made those changes, and branches become employable so as not to mess up the master code through experimentation and trial.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	It is literally a branch off of the master code. It is an exact copy of code that one can experiment and mess with, without altering the original code.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	It is a message attached to a certain action detailing what that action was and the name of the person who did the action.

* What is a merge conflict?
	A merge conflict occurs when you try to merge a new branch with a master branch, and Git doesn't know what to do. Once instance this could happen is when there is a discrepancy between two users' new branches.
