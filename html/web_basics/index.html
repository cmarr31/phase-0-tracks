		<h1>Music</h1>
		<h2>The direct route to the soul.</h2>
		<p>The eyes are a commonly accepted visual route to the soul, but what of an auditory route?</p>
		<strong><em>Music's waves are the auditory route!!</em></strong>
		<p>The modes through which music is created are:
			<ul>
				<li>Voice.</li>
				<li>Instruments.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>The process of music arising in one's mind and of being created is as follows:
			<ol>
				<li>Thought (conception).</li>
				<li>Thought becoming conscious.</li>
				<li>Sublimation.</li>
			</ol>
