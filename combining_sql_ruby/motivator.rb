# The Automated Self-Motivator #

# Create a program that allows a user to store motivating quotes, sayings
# and phrases along with the person who said the thing.
# They will need to be able to access, change, update, and edit all of 
# them at any time on command.
# Every time they turn on/turn off their Motivator, they should be
# prompted with a random quote from their database.
